A top-down schematic depicts a rectangular room containing arranged furniture and specific signs of disturbance.

A door is located in the upper right corner, hinged to swing inward. A long, rectangular unit lines the top wall, while a large L-shaped desk occupies the upper left corner. Two rectangular sofas sit in the center of the room, angled slightly toward each other. A bright beam of white light projects from a window on the bottom wall, creating a trapezoidal zone of illumination between the two sofas.

Several objects appear displaced on the left side of the room. A potted plant with spiky leaves lies tipped over near the L-shaped desk, pointing toward the center. Below the desk, a chair sits at an odd angle. Against the bottom left wall stands a T-shaped object, accompanied by a linear trail of jagged debris or fragments scattered on the floor to its right.
