A stylized overhead map depicts a section of a lake shoreline, featuring a winding path that connects a northern boat rental area to a southern beach entrance.

The right side of the image is dominated by a large body of grey-blue water, while the left side consists of brown terrain. A broad white path enters from the top left, curves around a central landmass, and leads down to a clearing at the bottom.

In the upper clearing, a small building icon sits near the water's edge. Directly below this structure, four boat silhouettes are lined up vertically in the water, indicating a dock. To the right of the building, a vehicle icon resembling a van is parked on a small patch of land jutting into the lake.

The lower clearing contains a small stand or booth with a scalloped roof. To the far left of this lower area, two small square markers flank the path as it exits the frame, suggesting a gateway or entrance.
