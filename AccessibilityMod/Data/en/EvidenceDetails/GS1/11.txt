A newspaper clipping features a sensational headline above a photograph of a couple standing before a lake, apparently unaware of a large creature behind them.

A red banner across the top reads "GIANT LIFEFORM APPEARS IN GOURD LAKE!" in white capital letters. A yellow, jagged explosion graphic in the top left corner contains the text "HOT NEWS!" A column of small text runs down the left side of the page, beginning with a large blue capital "A."

The large photograph dominates the layout. In the foreground, a young man and woman stand side-by-side near a metal railing, smiling directly at the camera. The man wears a gray jacket with a thick scarf, and the woman wears a tan coat. A large tree trunk angles into the frame from the left.

In the background, rising from the murky green water, is a dark silhouette resembling a plesiosaur with a long neck and a humped back. A bright, translucent white circle is superimposed over this figure to highlight its presence. A small caption runs along the bottom edge of the photo, partially referencing a photographer.
