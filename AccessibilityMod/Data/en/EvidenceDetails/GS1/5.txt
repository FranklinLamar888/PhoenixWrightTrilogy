A black-and-white illustration depicts a dramatic scene outside a residence where a costumed figure is impaled on a fence while two witnesses react in shock.

In the immediate foreground, a person wearing a bulky, segmented bodysuit—resembling armor—is arched backward over a wrought-iron fence. One of the fence's large, spear-point finials pierces through the figure's midsection. The body hangs limp over the barrier, with the head thrown back and obscured from view.

To the right, standing on the wooden steps of a house porch, a young man with messy hair and a headband looks down at the impaled figure with his mouth wide open. He wears a short-sleeved polo shirt and holds a tennis racket in his left hand. He stands behind the wooden railing of the porch, elevated above the fallen figure.

On the left side of the image, standing on the ground level, a woman with short hair wears a long, sleeveless dress and a scarf. She recoils from the incident, pressing both gloved hands against her mouth. The background displays the siding of the house, the porch structure, and a cloudy sky.
