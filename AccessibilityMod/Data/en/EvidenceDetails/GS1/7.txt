Two dark, silhouetted figures wearing trench coats face one another against a foggy background as the figure on the right fires a handgun at the figure on the left.

The scene is monochromatic, rendered in high-contrast black, white, and gray. Thick, indistinct fog or mist obscures the background, focusing attention entirely on the two subjects in the foreground. A bright, star-shaped muzzle flash erupts from the center of the image, illuminating the front of both figures while leaving their backs in deep shadow.

The figure on the right stands in profile facing left. This individual wears a long trench coat with a high, stiff collar. Their arm is extended straight forward, holding a semi-automatic pistol level with the chest of the opposite figure.

The figure on the left stands facing right, mirroring the shooter. This figure also wears a long trench coat with a high collar, creating a silhouette strikingly similar to the shooter's. The figure leans back slightly, appearing to recoil. Their right hand hangs near the hip, open with fingers slightly curled, illuminated by the flash of the gunshot. No facial features are visible on either person due to the backlighting and shadow.
