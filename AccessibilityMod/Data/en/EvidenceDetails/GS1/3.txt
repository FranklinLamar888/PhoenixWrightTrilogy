A black-and-white surveillance photograph captures a figure dressed as the Steel Samurai walking from right to left.

The individual wears a distinctive warrior costume, characterized by a sleeveless tunic, a topknot wig, and a large, coiled rope ornament mounted on the back. The figure holds a long spear upright in their left hand, which is the arm closest to the camera.

The costume's trousers are voluminous and appear ill-fitting; as the figure takes a step, the fabric of the trailing right leg drags noticeably along the ground, bunching at the foot.

The background consists of a row of thick tree trunks and a low hedge running parallel to the path. A vertical column of bright white light stands directly behind the figure, obscuring the trees in the center of the frame and suggesting an open gate or light source. The ground appears to be a flat, paved surface.
