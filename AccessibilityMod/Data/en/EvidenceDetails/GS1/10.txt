A black-and-white photograph depicts a man in a suit slumped in the corner of an elevator car next to a damaged door.

The man sits on the floor against the left wall, his legs extended forward into the center of the frame. He wears a suit, tie, and glasses, with his hair slicked back. His head tilts to the side, resting against the wall, and his right hand lies open, palm up, on the floor. A dark stain saturates the upper right side of his chest and lapel (viewer's left), and a thin trail of dark liquid runs from the corner of his mouth.

To the man's left stands the elevator control panel, featuring a vertical column of buttons and a small display screen. Indistinct text is printed on the panel's surface.

To the right of the control panel are the elevator's double doors. Each door contains a rectangular window. The window in the left elevator door features a prominent circular hole near the top, surrounded by a spiderweb pattern of cracks. The window in the right door appears intact.
