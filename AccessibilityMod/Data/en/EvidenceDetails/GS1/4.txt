A schematic map outlines the Global Studios lot, identifying two studios, a central gate, and an employee area.

The left section features two large square rooms connected by a hallway. "Studio 1" is located at the top left. The hallway extends to the right from Studio 1, with a branch leading downward into "Studio 2" at the bottom center.

To the right of the junction for Studio 2, a vertical barrier labeled "Gate" crosses the hallway, visually separating the two studios from the eastern section of the map. This gate is marked with diagonal stripes.

On the right side of the gate, the corridor forks. The northern path leads to an exit labeled "Main Gate." The southern path leads into a large room labeled "Employee Area." Inside the Employee Area, a dark rectangular section along the left wall is identified as the "Dressing Room."
