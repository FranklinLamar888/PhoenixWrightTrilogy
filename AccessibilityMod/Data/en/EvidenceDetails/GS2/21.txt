A promotional poster features a costumed superhero, the Nickel Samurai, striking a dynamic combat pose against a night backdrop of a full moon and a Japanese castle.

The central figure wears a blue and white samurai-themed costume. The head is covered by a blue helmet and a white mask with a stern, sculpted face; the black kanji character "丙" is printed on the center of the forehead. A red scarf flows dynamically behind the figure's neck. Distinctively, the figure's entire right arm is a bulky, mechanical contraption made of copper or bronze-colored metal, featuring visible gears and ending in sharp, articulated claws.

The figure stands in a wide, crouching stance. A thick white rope belt acts as a sash around the waist. The wide, hakama-style pants feature a bold blue and white wave pattern, reminiscent of the "Great Wave off Kanagawa." In the left hand, the samurai wields a long polearm with a brown shaft and a silver, trident-shaped blade consisting of three curved prongs.

The background depicts a dark, starry night sky dominated by a massive, pale moon on the left side. Pink cherry blossom petals are scattered throughout the scene, blown by an unseen wind. A blurred silhouette of a traditional Japanese castle is visible in the distance on the right. In the bottom right corner, large stylized text reads "Nickel SAMURAI," with "Nickel" in gold lettering and "SAMURAI" in a large, red-to-blue vertical gradient, accented by yellow lightning bolts.
