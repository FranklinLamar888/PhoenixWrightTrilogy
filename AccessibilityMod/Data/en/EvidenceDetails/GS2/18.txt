A black-and-white crime scene photograph depicts a man in a stage costume slumped lifelessly in a chair within a dressing room.

The victim is seated in the center, head bowed forward with eyes closed. He wears a costume consisting of mesh sleeves, layered rectangular shoulder guards, a breastplate with circular accents, and baggy pants. A light-colored scarf is tied around his neck. A knife is plunged into the right side of his chest (viewer's left), surrounded by a dark, spreading stain on the fabric of the costume. His arms hang limply at his sides, fingers curled inward.

Behind the victim stands a wooden vanity table with a large rectangular mirror and several drawers. On the desktop, a tall, thin glass containing liquid sits undisturbed.

To the right of the victim, a large guitar case lies open and empty on the floor. Between the chair and the guitar case, a broken vessel has scattered shards and liquid across the carpet, mixed with several cut flowers that appear to be roses. In the bottom right foreground, a bottle with a label depicting a large round fruit sits on a small circular table. A small, tube-like object lies on the floor in the bottom left corner.
