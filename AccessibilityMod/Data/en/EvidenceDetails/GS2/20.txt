A black-and-white photograph, taken at a severe tilt, captures a person in a costume standing in a hallway outside a guest room door.

The central figure is wearing the Nickel Samurai costume, identifiable by the large rope belt, the gear-like mechanism on the right shoulder, and the hakama pants featuring a wave pattern at the hem. They are holding up the bottom of their long pants with both hands, revealing that they are wearing split-toed socks (tabi) but no sandals or shoes.

To the right of the figure is a closed door with a lever handle and a blank rectangular nameplate. Next to the door stands a large, elaborate floral arrangement on a bamboo-style stand. Tucked at the very bottom of this floral arrangement, near the floor, is a small teddy bear.

The hallway stretches into the background on the left. The floor is covered in a carpet with a repeating geometric pattern. Behind the figure is another floral stand, and further down the hall, a decorative vase sits on a pedestal near a set of double doors in the distance.
