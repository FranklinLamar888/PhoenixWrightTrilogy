A schematic floor plan titled "Hotel Guidemap (Partial)" illustrates the layout of a hotel wing containing a lobby, a hall, and two guest rooms.

On the far right is a large circular area labeled "Lobby." To its left, a set of double doors connects the lobby to a large, vertically oriented rectangular room labeled "Viola Hall."

To the left of Viola Hall, another set of double doors leads into a narrow horizontal corridor. Two rectangular guest rooms flank this corridor: the room above the corridor is labeled "Engarde," and the room below is labeled "Corrida." Each guest room has a single door that opens into the shared corridor between them.
