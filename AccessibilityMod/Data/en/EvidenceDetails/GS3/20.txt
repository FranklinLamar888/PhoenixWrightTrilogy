An overhead map illustrates a forested region divided by a blue river, featuring "Hazakura Temple" on the western bank and the "Inner Temple" on the eastern bank, linked by a suspension bridge.

The landscape is rendered in simplified blocks of color. The left side consists of flat green terrain interspersed with large, dark brown irregular shapes representing dense forest. A beige path winds from the left edge of the map, branching northward to the main temple complex. This structure is depicted by a stylized icon of a traditional Japanese building with a dark roof, labeled "Hazakura Temple" in large white text.

The path continues eastward from the fork, widening into a rectangular clearing before reaching the riverbank. A wooden suspension bridge spans the vertical strip of blue water. The bridge deck is marked with vertical lines, and white suspension cables cross in an "X" shape, connecting anchor points on both sides of the river.

On the right bank, the terrain changes to a rugged, light-brown cliff face. The path resumes on this side, turning south to lead to a smaller, isolated building icon labeled "Inner Temple." This second temple is surrounded by the rocky cliff terrain and further dark brown forest sections, appearing more secluded than the main temple across the river.
