A newspaper page is defaced with thick black marker scribbles featuring crossed-out numbers, the text "MC Bomber," and a crude cartoon drawing.

The background consists of columns of grey, illegible newspaper text. In the upper right area, a blurry, indistinct photograph is visible, appearing to show a mechanical object or vehicle engine. The primary focus is the heavy graffiti overlaid on the page.

In the upper left, the number "100,000" is written and subsequently crossed out with a single horizontal line. To the right of the center, the words "MC Bomber" are enclosed within a large, hastily drawn circle. A hand-drawn arrow originates from this circle and points diagonally upward and to the left, directing attention toward the crossed-out "100,000." On the far right edge of the image, partially cut off, a dollar sign and the number "5" or "50" are visible, also crossed out.

Below the arrow and to the left of the circle, the laughter "Ahahahaha!" is scrawled in loose script. Directly beneath this text in the bottom left corner is a simple line drawing of a character. The figure wears a wide-brimmed hat adorned with a feather, a high-collared cape, and a mask covering the eyes. The character is depicted with a wide, toothy grin.
