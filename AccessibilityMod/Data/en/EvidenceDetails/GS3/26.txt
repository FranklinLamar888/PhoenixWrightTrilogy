A black-and-white crime scene photograph shows a person lying face-down in the snow, impaled through the lower back by a large, multi-branched sword held by a stone statue.

The victim lies prone across the foreground, oriented with their feet to the left and head to the right. They are dressed in a long, dark robe with wide sleeves and light-colored piping at the hem and cuffs. Strappy sandals are worn on their feet. Their right arm is extended forward into the snow, with the hand open and fingers slightly curled. Long hair spreads out near the head.

A massive sword with a distinctive shape—featuring several curved, branch-like protrusions extending from the main blade—stands vertically, piercing the victim's torso and pinning them to the ground. Dark stains, presumably blood, mar the white snow immediately surrounding the entry wound.

The hilt of the sword is gripped firmly in the hand of a large stone statue positioned directly behind the body. The statue depicts a seated figure, though only the lower portion and the hand holding the weapon are clearly visible; it is draped in robes and topped with patches of accumulated snow. To the far left, a wooden garden lantern or post stands vertically. The background features dark, rocky terrain and the shadowy mouth of a cave or tunnel.
