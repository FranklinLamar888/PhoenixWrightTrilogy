A young woman lying motionless inside the open trunk of a sedan.

The woman has short, bobbed hair and her eyes are closed. She is dressed in a light-colored, double-breasted trench coat and a skirt. She lies on her back with her body angled diagonally across the trunk; her legs are bent at the knees and tucked to the left. Her posture appears limp, with her hands resting loosely on her torso and side.

The trunk lid is fully open above her. The metal surrounding the latch mechanism on the underside of the lid is visibly damaged, with dark cracks radiating outward from the lock. The right rear taillight and the edge of the bumper are visible on the right side of the frame. The background shows a textured ground surface to the right of the vehicle.
