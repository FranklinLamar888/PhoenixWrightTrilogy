A vibrant, crayon-style drawing depicts a truss bridge engulfed in flames, with a glowing human silhouette floating in the deep purple sky above.

The image features a rough, textured artistic style using saturated colors. A bridge spans horizontally across the center, defined by black lines forming a truss pattern of repeating triangles between an upper and lower deck. Two heavy diagonal cables descend from the top corners of the frame, meeting at the center of the bridge deck to form a wide "V" shape.

Intense fire surrounds the structure. A continuous wall of jagged yellow and orange flames rises from the bottom of the frame, appearing to burn beneath the bridge. Another row of flames runs along the top of the bridge deck, sandwiching the structure in fire. The bright warm tones of the fire contrast sharply against the dark, solid purple background.

High above the bridge and the flames, a small, glowing figure floats in the center of the sky. The figure is a yellow and orange silhouette of a person, depicted with no detailed features. The body is angled as if flying or falling, positioned between the two suspension cables.
