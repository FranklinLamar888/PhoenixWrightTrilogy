The hanging scroll previously depicting a woman is now heavily defaced by a massive, opaque splatter of thick brown liquid.

The viscous substance, resembling curry or gravy, covers the vast majority of the central illustration. It dominates the cream-colored paper, completely obscuring the woman's head, torso, and the calligraphy that previously flanked her. The liquid appears to have been thrown against the scroll, dripping down in heavy, irregular rivulets towards the bottom.

Only the very top and bottom of the original artwork remain visible. The stylized black emblem at the top is untouched by the stain. At the bottom edge, the woman's feet in traditional sandals and the red square seal in the left corner are the only parts of the figure that have not been covered by the brown mess. The green patterned borders on the left and right sides remain clean.

A vertical hanging scroll displays an ink-style portrait of a woman in traditional attire, mounted between green patterned borders.

The central illustration depicts a woman standing and facing slightly to the left. She is dressed in a kimono secured by a wide, dark sash (obi) at her waist, with a loose, flowing robe draped over her shoulders. A necklace consisting of large, round beads rests around her neck, and her hair is gathered up. She wears traditional thonged sandals on her feet. The artwork simulates a brush-and-ink style with soft, grey shading against a cream-colored background.

Floating centered above the figure is a stylized black emblem. The design features a large, comma-shaped curve—resembling a magatama—surrounded by an arrangement of smaller dots and decorative, flame-like wisps.

Vertical columns of flowing, cursive calligraphy flank the woman on both the left and right sides. In the bottom left corner, a small, bright red square seal is stamped. The artwork is framed on the vertical edges by wide bands of green fabric featuring a repeating pattern of faint spirals.
