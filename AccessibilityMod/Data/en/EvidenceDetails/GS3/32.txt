An updated overhead map of the temple grounds now displays a third location, "Heavenly Hall," situated on the western bank of the river, north of the bridge.

The general geography remains consistent with the previous map. The "Hazakura Temple" complex is located in the upper left, while the "Inner Temple" remains isolated on the lower right, separated by the vertical strip of blue river water. The wooden suspension bridge still connects the central clearing on the western bank to the cliffside path on the eastern bank.

The new addition, "Heavenly Hall," is marked by a small icon of a building with a brown, thatched-style roof. It is positioned near the river's edge, directly north of the bridge entrance on the left side of the map. A short, beige path branches off from the main clearing near the bridge, leading upward to this structure.
