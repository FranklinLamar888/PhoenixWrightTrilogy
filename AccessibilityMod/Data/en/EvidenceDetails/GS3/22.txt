A woman dressed in a dark grey hooded robe smiles while holding a wooden staff and a book titled "The Magic Bottle" against a blurred background.

The woman is shown from the waist up, angled slightly toward the left. She wears a dark grey cloak with white piping along the edges and a hood pulled up over her head. Her brown hair is visible beneath the hood, framing her face. She wears a white bow tie at her neck and a pearl earring is visible on her left ear. She looks directly at the viewer with a confident, closed-mouth smile.

She holds a long, gnarled wooden staff diagonally across her body with her right hand. The top of the staff curves into a hook shape which cradles a glowing, bright purple sphere. Tucked securely under her right arm is a thick, brown hardcover book. The title, "The Magic Bottle," is printed on the front cover in gold, cursive script.

The background is out of focus, suggesting a depth of field effect. To the left, the sky is a soft, cloudy blue. To the right, a grey, stone castle structure is visible, tilted at a slight angle against a darker, purple-hued sky.
