A vertical hanging scroll displays an ink-style portrait of a woman in traditional attire, mounted between green patterned borders.

The central illustration depicts a woman standing and facing slightly to the left. She is dressed in a kimono secured by a wide, dark sash (obi) at her waist, with a loose, flowing robe draped over her shoulders. A necklace consisting of large, round beads rests around her neck, and her hair is gathered up. She wears traditional thonged sandals on her feet. The artwork simulates a brush-and-ink style with soft, grey shading against a cream-colored background.

Floating centered above the figure is a stylized black emblem. The design features a large, comma-shaped curve—resembling a magatama—surrounded by an arrangement of smaller dots and decorative, flame-like wisps.

Vertical columns of flowing, cursive calligraphy flank the woman on both the left and right sides. In the bottom left corner, a small, bright red square seal is stamped. The artwork is framed on the vertical edges by wide bands of green fabric featuring a repeating pattern of faint spirals.
