A grainy, black-and-white halftone image depicts a young woman standing next to a seated woman wearing a nun's habit.

The young woman stands on the right, facing slightly forward. She has long hair intricately styled in twin braids. She wears a hooded cape over a dress. Her hands are raised to her chest, clutching the sides of a large, distinctive ribbon tied in a bow with a spherical gem at its center. Her expression appears gentle and slightly melancholic.

To her left and lower in the frame, a woman with a rounder face sits wearing a wimple that covers her hair and neck, characteristic of a nun. She leans forward with a wide, closed-mouth smile, her chin resting on her clasped hands.

A vertical dark band runs along the right edge of the image, containing the partial white text "pecial" vertically aligned above the number "9" (likely part of the word "Special"). The image quality simulates a newspaper or magazine print with a visible dot texture. The background is blurred but suggests an interior space with hanging decorations.
