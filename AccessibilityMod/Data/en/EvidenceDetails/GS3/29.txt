A white sheet of paper containing typed text is heavily burnt along its right edge, destroying portions of the message.

The paper features black serif text on a white background. A large, irregular burn mark with charred black and brown edges consumes the right side of the page. This damage cuts off the ends of the lines in the upper paragraph, while the lower paragraph remains legible.

The text in the upper, damaged section reads:
"Be careful"
"Once night falls"
"should be there"
The burn mark obscures any text that may have followed these phrases.

Below a gap, the lower section reads:
"As soon as you hear the lights
out bell, you must channel her
spirit. Leave everything up to her."
