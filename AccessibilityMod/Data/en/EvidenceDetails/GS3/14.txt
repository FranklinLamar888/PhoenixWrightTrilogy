A black-and-white photograph captures a dining interior where a man lies slumped motionless over a table in the background, separated from an empty, set table in the foreground.

To the left, a table is formally set with a white cloth adorned with a decorative floral hem. A tall vase containing flowers stands at the edge, alongside a stemmed wine glass and arranged silverware. A high-backed chair is positioned at the table, upholstered in fabric featuring a repeating pattern of a cross motif and the letters "TB".

A vertical structural pillar and a partition wall covered in floral wallpaper divide the space. To the right of this divider, a second table is visible. A man wearing a suit jacket is collapsed over this surface, his head resting on the table surface amidst his sprawled arms.

Several small, rectangular cards are scattered on the table near the man's left hand, along with a small, overturned cup. A vase with flowers stands upright near the back edge of the table. The chair beneath him shares the same design and "TB" monogram as the one in the foreground.
