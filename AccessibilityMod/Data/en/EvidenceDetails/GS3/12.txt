A top-down floor plan depicts a kitchen and a dining area, with a bold red "X" marking a specific table in the upper right section.

The diagram uses a beige background with dark brown lines to represent walls and furniture. A vertical wall divides the space into two distinct rooms. On the left, a room is clearly labeled "Kitchen" in large, dark brown text with a white outline. A curved line indicates a door connecting the kitchen to the adjacent room, swinging inward into the kitchen space.

The area to the right appears to be a dining car or restaurant section containing four booths. These booths are arranged in two rows, with two booths at the top and two at the bottom, separated by a central aisle. Each booth consists of a square table flanked by two semi-circular seats facing one another. Vertical partition walls separate the booths within the rows.

A bright red "X" with a white outline sits directly on top of the table in the upper right booth. This mark distinguishes it from the other three identical seating arrangements. To the right of this marked booth, a partial wall structure suggests a corridor or entrance at the far edge of the room.
