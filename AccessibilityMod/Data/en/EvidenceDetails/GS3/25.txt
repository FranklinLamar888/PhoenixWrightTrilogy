A snowmobile sits parked in a snowy courtyard in front of a traditional gate, with distinct vehicle tracks and footprints marking the ground.

To the left, a large wooden gate structure stands with its right-hand door swung inward, revealing a pitch-black interior. A sign bearing Japanese calligraphy hangs horizontally above the entrance. The gate is connected to a high wall that runs across the background, capped with a thick layer of snow. Dark trees are visible rising behind the wall and on the far right side of the frame.

In the center of the clearing, a snowmobile is parked facing left, towards the open gate. The vehicle features a windshield, handlebars, front skis, and a rear tread track. It is stationary and unoccupied.

The snow-covered ground in the foreground prominently displays the path taken by the vehicle. A wide, textured track curves from the bottom center of the image, leading directly to the parked snowmobile. To the right of these machine tracks, a separate set of boot prints is visible in the snow, spaced out near a low wooden fence on the right edge of the area.
