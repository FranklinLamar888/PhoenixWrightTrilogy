A large man in a striped prisoner's uniform stands on a suspension bridge facing a woman dressed in a trench coat and scarf, amidst heavy rain.

The man stands on the left side of the bridge with his back mostly to the viewer. He has a massive, muscular build and wears a shirt and trousers with horizontal stripes, along with a small matching skullcap. A length of chain hangs down from his hands, which are held together in front of his chest, suggesting he is handcuffed. He appears to be barefoot on the wooden planks.

Facing him on the right side of the bridge is a young woman. She wears a brimmed hat and a light-colored trench coat that is buttoned up. A scarf is wrapped around her neck. She stands calmly with her arms at her sides, looking directly at the man.

The bridge itself is a rope suspension structure with wooden floorboards, spanning a misty, grey void. To the left, a dark, jagged cliff face serves as the anchor point for the bridge. Diagonal white streaks overlaid on the scene indicate that it is raining.
