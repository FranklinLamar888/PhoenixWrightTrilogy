A destroyed suspension bridge spans a deep, snowy canyon, consisting now only of sagging cables after the wooden floor completely collapsed.

The bridge is entirely impassable. The walkway is gone, leaving two thick, parallel suspension cables stretching across the chasm and drooping heavily in the center. Vertical support wires hang uselessly from these main cables, disconnected and dangling over the void. A few remnants of the wooden structure cling to the cables near the left side, and a single long line hangs straight down from the center point, reaching nearly to the water below.

The canyon is defined by sheer, vertical cliffs rendered in shades of grey. The rock face on the left is jagged, with patches of snow resting on the rocky outcroppings. The cliff on the right is topped with a snow bank, where a wooden post structure anchors the cables.

Far below, a dark river flows through the bottom of the gorge. In the background, a ridge line dotted with coniferous trees sits beneath distant, pale mountains.
